<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I've always loved the idea of chatrooms. All the messaging apps I know and use are always a part of another larger app that clutters and distracts me most of the time. I wanted to make a simple chatroom application that takes advantage of the command line.
